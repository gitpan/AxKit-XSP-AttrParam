### AxKit::XSP::AttrParam - XSP taglib for HTTP request parameters

The XSP AttrParam tag library implements a simple way to access HTTP
request parameters (query string and posted form data) by field name.
it is shamelessly stolen from Kip Hampton's AxKit::XSP::Param but
allows one to use parameter names that may not be valid XML names, as
well as parametre names derived from expressions.

Prerequisites
=============

AxKit 1.3_95

Installation
============

It can be installed in the usual ways:

 - from within the cpan shell (perl -MCPAN -e shell):

   install AxKit::XSP::AttrParam

 - after having downloaded it from CPAN, and extracted from its
 archive:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

Support
=======

You may write to me for support, as well probably as to the
axkit-users forum (see http://axkit.org/ for more details).

This module is licensed under the same terms as Perl itself.

The human brain is a wonderful thing, but it is also a result of
three billion years' worth of "good enough" implementation. As a
result, it is a giant hack with more than a few quirks.
